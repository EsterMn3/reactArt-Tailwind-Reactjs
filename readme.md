## Features

- Email and password input fields with validation
- Login button that triggers the login process
- Success message displayed when the login is successful
- Styled using Styled Components for a clean and modern design

## How It Works

1. The user enters their email and password in the input fields.
2. When the login button is clicked, the `handleLogin` function is called.
3. The function checks if the email and password are valid (i.e., the email contains an `@` symbol and the password is at least 6 characters long).
4. If the inputs are valid, a success message is displayed, and the input fields are cleared.
5. If the inputs are invalid, an error message is displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for building the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling the components
- **JavaScript** for handling the login logic
